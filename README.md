# 👋 Hi, I'm Jack

I'm an iOS Developer who’s passionate about building meaningful apps that make life easier — not just for others, but for myself too.

## 🚀 What Drives Me

I believe that every project is an opportunity to learn, grow, and give back. Whether it’s simplifying a daily task, exploring new frameworks, or solving a small annoyance with code — I create to improve both my world and others'.

## 🛠️ What I Do

- Design and develop iOS applications with Swift and SwiftUI  
- Explore new tools, APIs, and patterns to level up my skills  
- Share projects that solve real problems and help people  
- Constantly challenge myself through side projects and experiments  

## 🎯 Why I’m Here

This GitHub is where I build, learn, and document my journey.  
Each repository is a step toward becoming a better developer, problem solver, and creator.
